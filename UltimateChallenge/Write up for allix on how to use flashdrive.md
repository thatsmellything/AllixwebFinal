Write up for allix on how to use flashdrive for this next challenge


1. Plug in the flashdrive to a computer (lets go with mac to make it easy)
2. Turn the mac on while holding the options key down
3. Select the usb thingy that comes up. more often than not it looks yellow
4. from there select the "live mode" once it all boots up. do this quick because it can disappear
5. boom youre in, pretty sure that is the hardest part.
6. Okay now you are going to basically just copy paste exactly what is in the quotations ot make this all work
7. welllllll first you do have to download a file, it will be in my google drive, all you gotta do is download it and make sure that it is in your downloads folder.
HERE BE THE FIRST FILE YOURE GONNA DOWNLOAD
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rsVpIiBB1W0s056lgRLz-n2jj8srfQu2/view?usp=sharing

8. Boooom not too hard right? now what you want to do is open the terminal. Its a little grey/black box in the top left. It pulls up a black screen and there is only words that pop up. this is where most of the work work begins. first youre gonna type "sudo apt-get alien", IF THERE IS AN ERROR SAYING LIKE YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY TYPE BLAH BLAH BLAH DONT STRESS JUST TYPE THAT IN AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BUT USUALLY THIS WONT BE AN ISSUE.
9. alien will be installed and thennnnn what you gotta do is type "cd Downloads" this will put you in the downloads folder pretty much but just in the terminal. Kinda neat.
10. okay nowwwww youll type "alien --to-deb jre-10.0.2_linux-x64_bin.rpm" easy peasy hen ban youre very good at this. what that did is installed a version of java onto your computer sooooo woot wooot you can run my program pretty much
11. youre gonna type "git clone https://github.com/thatsmellything/javuls.git" this will download my program to your computer. And since youre already in the downloads folder it will just be right there. If you type "ls" and hit enter youll see all the files there and now there should be one called JaVuls.
12. type "cd JaVuls" now youre in the directory with my program in it. woot woot so close allllixxxxx
13. this is the long one, type "/usr/java/jre-10.0.2/bin/java -jar JaVuls.jar" boooooom should be running my programmmmmm now gooood luckkkkkk 143 <3
