         <p>Hot dang you got it my lady! You really are pretty good at solving puzzles. But anyways this aint about the puzzle its about youuuuu. My dearest darling Allix, you are my greatest friend in this world. I never did think that I could ever be so close to someone who feels so far away at the same time. To be honest when I talk to you I can still imagine you being here right next to me. You are by far my greatest and best friend I have ever come to know in this world. And if i'm being honest I think we must've been pretty good freakin pals before coming on down here cause like its kinda a little crazysauce if we weren't. JC really either did this to us for a reason in my opinion or he freakin just let me draw the lottery in terms of best friends on this stinking planet. For reals Allix you make me so happy. You can raise my spirits unlike anyone else. And I know that sometimes it may not seem like that but trust me if anyone can do it it's you. I love everything about you my lady, from your silly conversations, to your drive to be better, to your high ambitions and lowest of lazies. I love it all. You make me so happy to allow me to call you my girlfriend. Sometimes its a stinking curse i'll be honest. When I can't kick you out of my brain and just wondering what you're up to and if you're safe or not. Jeez louis I hope you're safe way to stinkin much xD. I don't know what I would do without you but I know I wouldn't be very happy. I know from experience you've pulled me out of some dark places my lady. Always coming in so clutch. It's like sometimes I start to drown but Allix is the lifeguard of mental health and she knows when some funk be up. And while sometimes it may be rough, you always do end up getting my little heart back up and beating. Lil trooper you are for putting up with my crap miss Nielson. For reals thats something to brag about in its own right. "My boyfriend is demanding but i'm too clutch"-Allix. But anyways my lady, I just wanted you to know this valentines day that I truly do love you. I freakin pray and hope and dream that even if we don't make it (which fyi I hope we do cause then I wont have to worry about this) that we can still saty buddies from here on out, forever and ever. I love you dearly, I hope your day is fantastic even though I could not be in it, and know that I love you from the deepest part of my soul. My little onion shrek heart has been pierced to the core by you. Every atom in my bod is just tingling with love and magic for the girl named Allix Nielson. I love you my beautiful, wonderful, amazing, smart and more girlfriend. Have a wonderful day, and next week we get to see each otherrrrr woot wooooooootttt!!!! I LOVE YOU ALLIXXXX HAPPY VALENTINES DAYYYYYY!!!! URL = challenge7shakespeare</p>
