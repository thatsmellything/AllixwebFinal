ayyoooo part three soooo this isnt all of your gifts ya see. part of your gift will be coming hopefully very soon but i truly cannot promise anything so im just gonna tell you on here. i am printing our the film pictures that we took over the summer and giving you the copies and the negatives. hopefully they turn out really cool and cute but idk its also been both of our first times using a film camera so i guess we shall see. i hope you really like your gifts and i know the buildup for them was kinda high and in reality they arent even all too good. but i know that they will be something that you use like every day unlike all of my past gifts haha. so i hope you like them and i love you sooooo much. merry merry christmas my dearest darling lady allix nielson
